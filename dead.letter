Subject: Call for resumes



Hello all~~~

Recruiters will be present at the Tau Beta Pi National Conference this October. 
The host campus in Denver has requested that each chapter send a resume book to 
the participating companies.  To this end, I write to you asking that if you 
would like your resume included you must
	*send it as a pdf or MS Word file to krutina@gmail.com
	*have the subject of your message read "Resume for Denver"
	*title your resume file according to the convention
	 "LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_XXX.ext" where XXX stands for your 3 or 4
	 letter major (ECE, CIVE, ect) and .ext is either pdf or doc.
	*submit the file BEFORE 11:59pm on FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29th.
All received resumes will be bound together as a chapter, so no coverletter is 
necessary.

If you would like more information about the recruiters, visit the Convention 
link from the national TBP site (www.tbp.org).

Feel free to address questions to Krutina (krutina@gmail.com) or me 
(hclove@uh.edu or tbp@egr.uh.edu).



Thanks for participating and have an awesome weekend!!!
~~~Holley


p.s.  special thanks to all the members who turned out for the 1st meeting!
